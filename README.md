# Visualising the Hidden Neurons of a Non-convolutional DNN Trained on the MNIST Database

This is an independent research project I (Ben Auer) undertook as part of the subject Real and Artifical Neural Networks (NEUR30006) at the University of Melbourne. This repository includes the final project report and the Jupyter notebook containing all the code used to create the report, mostly for ease of sharing my work with others. The network was trained and visualised entirely in NumPy, without using any modern ML packages, as this was prohibited by the course.

## Files

* [`Visualising Hidden Neurons Project Report Final.pdf`](Visualising%20Hidden%20Neurons%20Project%20Report%20Final.pdf): The final project report as a PDF (17 pp).
* [`Visualising Hidden Neurons Code Final.ipynb`](Visualising%20Hidden%20Neurons%20Code%20Final.ipynb): The complete Jupyter notebook.

## Usage

The following can be done straightforwardly in the Jupyter notebook:
* Loading and visualising the hidden neurons of any pre-trained non-convolutional MNIST classifier DNN
* Training and visualising a new classifier DNN (with any neuron / layer configuration)
* Saving and reloading visualisation images (28x28)

The code could likely be adapted for usage with convolutional DNNs too, and any contributions towards this would be welcomed with interest.
